Weather Analysis Project - README
===============================

Description:
------------
This project analyzes weather data from 'large_weather_data.csv' to generate clear, actionable climate and seasonal insights directly using Python and CSV workflows.

Included:
---------
1. large_weather_data.csv (your raw sales data)
2. README.md (this documentation)

Analysis Provided:
------------------
Data Cleaning:
- Removed missing and duplicate rows.
- Converted 'Rainfall', 'Temperature', and 'Wind Speed' columns to numeric.
- Parsed 'Date' into datetime format.

Feature Engineering:
- Extracted 'Month', 'Day', and 'Year' from the 'Date'.
- Categorized weather patterns (e.g., rainy, dry, extreme temperature).

Insights generated:
- **Monthly Rainfall Patterns:** Identified wettest and driest months.
- **Temperature Trends:** Analyzed average temperatures over time.
- **Hourly/Time-Based Trends:** Tracked temperature or weather changes by time of day.
- **Humidity & Wind Analysis:** Studied their distribution and influence on weather.
- **Extreme Weather Events:** Highlighted days with highest rainfall or temperature deviations.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Load `large_weather_data.csv` into your Python environment using pandas

2. Use the provided structured Python scripts to:
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Generate month-wise and seasonal breakdowns.
- Visualize climate trends using matplotlib or seaborn.
- Analyze temperature, rainfall, and other variables to support planning and research.

Dependencies:
-----------
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
